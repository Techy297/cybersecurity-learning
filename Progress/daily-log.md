**Time spent:** 2.5 hours

### What I studied
- Linux permissions (read, write, execute)
- SUID concept and purpose

### What I practiced
- Listed SUID binaries using `find`
- Checked permissions using `ls -l`

### Key understanding
- SUID allows a binary to run with the file owner's privileges, not the user’s

### Confusions / Questions
- Still unclear about when SGID is required on directories

### Next step
- Understand SGID on directories with examples
